// Bayview's surfaces: white-washed plaster, weathered render, blue corrugated
// joinery, flagged stone lanes, concrete trim, quay masonry and plank decking.
//
// ## Why every surface is world-projected
//
// town.ts builds each solid as `new BoxGeometry(w, h, d)` and hands it ONE
// material. A box's UVs run 0..1 on every face, so a texture `repeat` of (n, n)
// puts n tiles across a face whatever that face actually measures. The old
// "pre-tiled variant" scheme picked n from the building's longest side, which
// made two errors at once:
//
//   * Across faces. The 30 x 14 x 6.4 m south block took n = 6 from its 30 m
//     side, so its 30 m wall got a 5 m tile (right) and its 14 m return got a
//     2.3 m tile — the same plaster at two scales on one building, and a third
//     scale on the neighbour that happened to round to a different variant.
//   * Across the vertical. The variant's V repeat was
//     `round(repeats * tileMetres / tileMetres)`, which is just `repeats`. Wall
//     height never entered it, so that 6.4 m-tall wall also got 6 tiles top to
//     bottom: a 1.07 m tile vertically against a 5 m tile horizontally, i.e.
//     the plaster photo stretched to a 4.7:1 aspect. Stretched-out stucco with
//     no relief is exactly what "the texture looks really odd" describes, and
//     it applied to all thirty buildings, both plazas and the quay.
//
// A `repeat` cannot express "one tile per N metres" on a box, so this file does
// not try. Every textured surface is a `MeshStandardNodeMaterial` whose maps are
// sampled triplanar from WORLD position, at a fixed metres-per-tile. Face size,
// building size and mesh orientation drop out of the result: one metre of wall
// is one metre of texture everywhere in the town, and neighbouring buildings
// agree because they read the same world-space field. The `plaster(size)` /
// `brick(size)` signature is kept so town.ts is untouched; the argument is now
// ignored, because there is nothing left for it to select.
//
// ## Constraints this file has to respect
//
//   * `CanvasTexture` samples BLACK under `WebGPURenderer`, so no map here is
//     ever painted procedurally. Variation comes from TSL noise instead, which
//     is evaluated in the shader and never touches a 2D canvas.
//   * Node materials need the WebGPU renderer. The framework's WebGL2 fallback
//     cannot draw them — the same is already true of `renderer.setOutputNode`,
//     which `@threenative/core` refuses on any other backend.
//   * A `THREE.Line` cannot take a node material here, so the mast/wire material
//     stays a plain `MeshStandardMaterial`.
//   * `{ normalMap: undefined }` is not the same as omitting the key: Three logs
//     "parameter 'normalMap' has value of undefined" for the explicit one. The
//     old crate and deck materials passed it that way and printed the warning
//     twice on every boot; nothing here passes a key it does not have a map for.
