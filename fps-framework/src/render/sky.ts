// The shipped sky is an equirectangular outdoor photograph used three ways at
// once: as the visible background, as the scene's image-based light, and as the
// colour the fog fades distance toward. Keeping all three off one image is what
// makes the town sit in its weather instead of floating in front of a backdrop.
//
// `bayview-sky.jpg` is Poly Haven's partly-cloudy midday pure sky, tonemapped to
// an equirect JPEG. The previous `sky.jpg` was an overcast grey, and an overcast
// environment is most of why the whole scene read flat: with no blue overhead
// there was nothing to separate a sunlit wall from a shaded one.
//
// --- Why background and environment are two different images ---------------
//
// They were one image until 2026-08-23, and that cost 48 MiB of GPU memory for
// nothing. Three.js sizes the PMREM (image-based-light) render target from the
// *source equirect's* width: `PMREMGenerator` takes `cubeSize = width / 4`,
// rounds it down to a power of two, and allocates a ping-pong pair of
// `3 * max(cubeSize, 112)` by `4 * cubeSize` half-float targets. Feeding it the
// 3072-wide background gives `cubeSize = 512` and therefore two 1536x2048
// `rgba16float` targets — measured on a physical Pixel 8 as the
// `1536x2048 rgba16float` n=2, 48 MiB bucket in `TN_GPU_TEXTURES`.
//
// The background genuinely needs those 3072 pixels: it is the thing the player
// looks at, and downsampling it puts visible mush on the horizon. The
// environment does not. PMREM immediately convolves the source into roughness
// mips, so all the light it contributes is low-frequency; the only detail that
// survives at roughness 0 is a mirror reflection, and the sharpest reflector in
// this town is painted steel. A 1024-wide source gives `cubeSize = 256` — two
// 768x1024 targets, 12 MiB — which is still a 256px cube face in a mirror.
//
// So the background keeps the full equirect and the environment gets
// `bayview-sky-ibl.jpg`, a 1024x512 Lanczos reduction of the same photograph,
// which is the same weather at a resolution the light can actually use. Both
// still feed `Fog`, which only ever wanted one colour.
//
// The deliberate choice is 1024, not 512: 512 would take another ~9 MiB but
// halves the mirror again, and this scene has metal in it. Revisit that if a
// later measurement says the metal never reads.
