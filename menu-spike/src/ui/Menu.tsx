/**
 * The menu, and the one thing a UI has to do differently from a plain web app: say which of its
 * elements the player can touch.
 *
 * `data-tn-interactive` is that mark. The native input host publishes those rectangles and decides,
 * on pointer-down, whether a touch belongs to the UI or to the game underneath. Everything without
 * the mark is scenery, and a touch on it reaches the game — which is what lets a HUD cover the
 * screen without swallowing the controls.
 *
 * `pointer-events` is still worth setting for the web target's own hit-testing; it is not what
 * makes a touch fall through on a phone, and marking a button with it instead is the one mistake
 * this comment exists to prevent.
