/**
 * The loading screen, and the reason the game does not start visible.
 *
 * The framework does two things before a scene is worth looking at: every shader is compiled the
 * first time something using it is drawn, and `SceneCollapse` folds the scene in a single frame.
 * On a Pixel 8 that was 2.9 s of a map assembling itself in pieces followed by a 3.5 s freeze.
 *
 * Covering it is not only cosmetic — it is most of the speed-up. Hidden geometry is never drawn,
 * so the shaders for the thousands of meshes the collapse is about to merge away are never
 * compiled at all: launch to a finished picture went from 2,877 ms to 1,051 ms by hiding the world
 * during startup. Then, still behind the screen, the merged geometry's pipelines are built with
 * `compileAsync`, because revealing before that leaves objects drawing solid black for about a
 * second while their shaders compile.
 *
 * Create it **after** the scene is populated: it hides what is in the scene when it is made.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const loading = createLoadingScreen(ctx);   // after the world is built
 * // ...inside the frame function:
 * loading.update();
 * ```
 *
 * This is yours. Colours, layout and the shape of the bar are here, in your source, and deleting
 * the file is a supported way to opt out.
