# FRICTION — grove

1. **No vegetation capability.** `engine_search_capabilities("foliage vegetation trees wind sway")`
   returns `verdict: none`. Tree generation and wind were copied from the engine repo's
   `examples/integrations/vegetation/src/`, which an installed game cannot see.
2. **`ez-tree-source` exports only its prebuilt bundle**, which eagerly loads textures. The pinned
   source entry is reached through a `vite.config.ts` alias plus `src/vegetation/ez-tree.d.ts`.
3. **The template's atmosphere sky is dark and faceted at midday** (0.2.6 `minimal`, identical on
   engine develop). At 13.5 h, with the sun 60° up, `atmosphere.radiance(view) * 8` renders a
   ~100/255 grey vault with visible arcs. The arcs stay at 96×48 dome segments and vanish when the
   dome ignores `radiance`, so they come from the radiance lookup, not the mesh. Replaced here with
   a game-owned gradient dome + `Fog`; the atmosphere still aims and colours the sun.
4. **Held state needs `allowTrivial`.** Values set once (`treeCount`, sun angles) are rejected as
   trivial unless every comparator carries a written reason.
5. **Leaf and bark winds must share one setting.** With a shared height envelope, different
   amplitudes slide each leaf off its twig; the first pass used 0.35/0.15 m.
6. **The LOD bake refuses the trees' own `_wind` attribute.** `assets.lod: {}` runs, and every build
   prints `lod trees/tree-<seed>.glb: no primitive was eligible (2 skipped: unsupported-attributes)`.
   `packages/assets/src/lod/eligibility.ts` allows only `POSITION NORMAL TANGENT TEXCOORD_0/1
   COLOR_0`, and `TN_discrete_lod` levels are index-only, so the simplifier never rewrites a custom
   attribute and the refusal is stricter than the bake needs. Consequence: no chain exists, so
   `lodBarkCoarse` is 0 at every distance and `playtests/grove-lod.playtest.json` asserts the truth
   with the intended `gte: 1` written down. The one-line engine change is to let a primitive through
   whose only unsupported semantics are carried through unchanged. **Fixed in the engine** (ThreeNative PR #333,
   `c735685be`): `_`-prefixed application attributes are shared by every level; bark now bakes
   2-3 levels per variant and `grove-lod` asserts all 14 bark geometries are drawn.
7. **The cook's `prune` pass deletes `TEXCOORD_0`,** because a tree's glTF materials are the
   exporter's neutral placeholders and declare no texture, while the game's procedural leaf cut-out
   reads `uv()`. With the UV gone every leaf quad is `length(uv()-0.5) == 0.5`, so `maskNode`
   discards the whole canopy — and no automated gate notices, because trunks and sky keep the frame
   non-blank. Declined with `assets.models.passes.prune: false`.
8. **A cooked one-component attribute reaches three's WebGPU path as an integer.** `quantize` turns
   `_WIND` into a normalized USHORT, and three's `WebGPUAttributeUtils._getVertexFormat` picks the
   vertex format for `itemSize === 1` from the array type alone, ignoring `normalized` — so the
   buffer stays `uint16` where the TSL `attribute("_wind", "float")` node declares a float and Dawn
   fails the pipeline: `renderPipeline_ShadowMaterial_106: Attribute base type (Uint for
   VertexFormat::Uint32) does not match the shader's base type (Float) in location (2)`. **Fixed in the engine** (PR #333,
   `5f0abb927`): the model loader widens normalized one-component attributes; the game-side widen
   was deleted.
9. **The far (LOD) framing stood past the scene's own fog and ground.** `Fog(45, 170)` and a 400 m
   ground plane put the proof camera at z=170 inside the fog and looking over the floor's edge, so
   the view existed to prove a grove and showed a white smear. Far plane to 600, ground to 1200; the
   near framing never sees past 60 m of either.
10. **Native LOD state reads lag the rendered frame.** On desktop and the Android emulator the
    engine's own triangle meter reaches the same fully-coarse chain as web (shadow triangles
    216,172 -> 117,128), yet the game's `mesh.geometry !== baseGeometryOf(mesh)` count ends at 6 of
    22 where web reads 22 of 22. Native scenarios therefore assert only `lodBarkCoarse >= 1` and
    `lodLeafCoarse == 0`; the strict 14-geometry assertion stays on web. Cause not yet isolated.
11. **Engine fixes arrive as private tarballs** (`.packages/grove/*-veg-*.tgz`) until the next
    release; repoint `@threenative/core` and `@threenative/assets` to npm once it ships.
