/**
 * Editable appearance, intentionally not an engine preset. This lane is for ordinary meshes.
 * `amplitude` and `height` are world metres and `direction` is world space, so the sway reads the
 * same at any scale: the displacement is built in world space and pushed through the inverse world
 * matrix unnormalized, which is what keeps it world metres once the asset cook has put a
 * dequantization scale on a node. The envelope is the baked `_wind` weight, a share of tree height
 * measured before that cook, so bark and leaves of one tree move as one.
 * The normal adjustment assumes a yaw plus a uniform node scale, which is what a placement and the
 * cook produce; a non-uniform scale tilts it by the same factor the mesh itself is tilted.
