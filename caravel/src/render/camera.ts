 * The offset used to be a constant in world axes, which was fine while the ship could only travel
 * along -Z. Now that the helm turns the hull, a fixed offset means the camera watches the ship
 * from whatever side it has turned towards: sail west and the shot is the transom, sail east and
 * the bowsprit comes at the lens. Rotating the offset by the heading keeps the rig against the
 * sky, which is the shot this game is about.
 *
 * The position is eased and the aim point is not. Easing the aim as well makes the horizon lag
 * the turn and the whole frame swim; easing only the position gives the camera the weight of
 * something being towed astern while the ship stays where the player put it.
