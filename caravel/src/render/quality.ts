// Generated for you: ordinary Three.js; ThreeNative does not read this file. Delete or rewrite
// it freely — the tiers below are a starting point, not a framework look.
//
// This is the one place this game decides how expensive it looks. `postprocessing.ts` reads
// `qualityPreset(resolveQualityTier(...))` and nothing else, so "make it run on a phone" is one
// file to edit rather than a hunt through anonymous literals.
//
// **Where the numbers come from.** Every millisecond below is GPU time from the per-stage
// ablation recorded in the engine repository's `docs/verification/runtime-perf-state.md`: Chrome
// on an RTX 2080, 1600x900, static build, `gpuMs` read from three's `timestamp-query`. In that
// scene the whole five-stage chain costs **12.5 ms of a 14.7 ms GPU frame**, and the same frame
// with every stage off costs **2.2 ms**. The per-stage figures oversum — removing SSGI also
// removes the denoise passes the later stages sample — so read each as *what turning this one off
// gave back*, not as a share of a partition. A stage nobody has ablated on its own says
// `unmeasured` rather than guessing, and your scene is not that scene: read `TN_FRAME_BUDGET`
// back after you change a tier.
//
// One cost that is **not** a stage here and outweighs most of them: the prefiltered reflection
// probe on `scene.environment`, measured at **~6.3 ms of an 18-19 ms Pixel 8 frame**. It is set
// in `sky.ts`, not in this file.
//
// **This template runs neither SSGI nor SSR at any tier.** Its frame cost is the water — a
// displaced 96x96 plane with its own material — not the post chain, and a screen-space reflection
// over moving water reads as smear. That is a template decision recorded here, not an omission:
// the two most expensive stages in the reference ablation are off on a desktop as well as on a
// phone, which is also why the rung between the tiers is bloom strength and nothing else.
