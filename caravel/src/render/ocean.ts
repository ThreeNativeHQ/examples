// Generated for you. The sea's tuning and its entire look live in this file, and ThreeNative does
// not read it. `SpectralOcean` runs the simulation and draws nothing: the mesh, the material, the
// colours, the foam line and the tessellation are all decisions this game makes here.
//
// This replaces a two-wave `WaveField` under a `MeshBasicNodeMaterial`. Both halves of that were
// the problem. Two analytic waves plus one domain warp is a corrugated sheet — it repeats visibly
// within a boat length, and no amount of colour work hides a surface with two frequencies in it.
// And a *basic* material takes no lights at all, so the sea could not respond to the sun the rest
// of the scene is lit by: its brightness had to be hand-computed with a `pow(dot(n, sun), 30)`
// term standing in for a specular highlight. Water is one of the few surfaces where the specular
// *is* the material, so that read as plastic.
//
// A spectral ocean is cascaded wave spectra inverse-transformed on the GPU every frame, which is
// what real water is, and a standard node material puts it back under the scene's own lights.
