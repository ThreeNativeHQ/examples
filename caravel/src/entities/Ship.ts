    // term inside `Buoyancy3D` is computed from the body's *linear* velocity, so it is identical
    // at every point and damps no rotation at all. The torque therefore accumulates with nothing
    // opposing it, and within a few seconds of spawning the ship is tumbling. It always was: the
    // template's own first frame showed the old model lying on its side, and that read as "the
    // boat is a plank" rather than as a boat rolled ninety degrees.
