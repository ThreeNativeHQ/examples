 * `solid` crates occupy the default collision layer, so the warden's capsule scans them and is
 * stopped by them. `phase` crates occupy a layer the warden's mask does not include, so they are
 * simulated against the floor and against each other exactly like the solid ones — they fall,
 * stack and are shoved by a solid crate — while the warden's own sweep never sees them.
 *
 * The distinction is a collision layer, not a sensor: a sensor collider would also stop colliding
 * with the crates around it, and a phase crate that fell through the floor would not read as
 * "walk through me", it would read as broken.

/**
 * Three layers, and the third one is the reason this is not two.

 *
 * The ward has to fall, stack on itself and rest on the floor, so it cannot be a sensor; and it
 * has to be transparent to *everything the player can move*, not only to the warden. A ward that
 * blocked crates while letting the warden through produced a dead level: the warden shoved a crate
 * north, the crate wedged against the ward, and the warden — already touching that crate — could
 * not advance a single millimetre toward the seal. `playerZ` was bit-identical to its spawn value
 * after two hundred ticks of held input, which reads exactly like an input binding that never
