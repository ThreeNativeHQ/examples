/**
 * The way out, and the only thing in the game that can end the run.
 *
 * It is an `Area3D` and nothing else: the run ends when the physics backend reports that a body
 * has *overlapped* this volume — the warden's capsule, or a crate the warden shoved into it. No
 * distance check, no timer, no "close enough". If the solver never reports contact the run never
 * ends, which is the point: a proximity test would pass on a warden standing on the far side of a
 * crate it could not actually move.
