/**
 * Measure a carrier's flight deck out of the shipped GLB, with no browser.
 *
 * `src/sim/battle.ts` needs three numbers per carrier that no class reference can supply: the deck
 * datum (the horizontal surface an aircraft's wheels sit on), and the launch/recovery corridor, a
 * rectangle centred on the ship's origin that an aircraft can actually roll down. Enterprise,
 * Hornet and Akagi were surveyed by raycasting their own decks in the running game
 * (tools/capture-deck.mjs), which is where their 220 x 20 m corridor came from. This does the same
 * survey for the imported hulls, in node, so a re-import can regenerate the table in seconds:
 *
 *   node tools/measure-decks.mjs                     # every imported carrier
 *   node tools/measure-decks.mjs public/assets/x.glb # one file
 *
 * Method, in order:
 *
 *  1. The deck plane is the elevation carrying the largest upward-facing triangle area. A flight
 *     deck is the biggest horizontal surface on a carrier by a wide margin, so this finds it
 *     without knowing anything about the ship, and it ignores the island roof, which is small.
 *  2. The profile is raycast down the centreline in 1 m steps, keeping only hits inside a band
 *     around that plane: a ray that lands on the island is not the deck, and neither is one that
 *     falls through to the hangar.
 *  3. The datum is the midpoint of the deck's own elevation range over the corridor, so a single
 *     static number sits centred in a deck that slopes rather than at one end of it, and the
 *     residual sheer is reported for the tolerance that a static datum can honestly hold.
 *  4. The corridor is the largest rectangle centred on the origin whose every 5 m station has
 *     unobstructed deck out to the half-width: walking outboard stops at the island, at a
 *     sponson step and at the deck edge alike, because an aircraft stops at all three.
 *
 * The keel is reported as measured: the imported hulls ship it at y = 0, and `src/render/world.ts`
 * sinks each one by its class draught so the waterline, not the keel, meets the sea.
