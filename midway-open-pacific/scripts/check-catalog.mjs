/**
 * Catalog/manifest consistency check (PRD AC-1). Proves the packaged file the game actually names is
 * the bytes the manifest recorded: every cue in `CUE_FILES` and every speech slug resolves to a
 * generated manifest row whose recorded SHA-256 equals the shipped Ogg. It also reports packaged
 * cues that no code path consumes yet, so an unconsumed cue cannot pass silently as shipped.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/check-catalog.mjs
