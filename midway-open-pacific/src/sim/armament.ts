// Every figure below is cited to a section of docs/reference-dimensions.md, which holds the source
// link and the arithmetic. All speeds are **m/s**; the cited knots value is shown beside each one so
// a unit regression is visible on the page. Nothing in `src/sim/` ever holds knots — the HUD converts
// at its own boundary.
//
// SHIPPED BODY. `public/assets/weapon.torpedo.glb` is 4.089 m long and 0.569 m in diameter
// (`WEAPON_BODIES.torpedo` in ./catalog.ts): that is a **Mark 13** and nothing else. The uniform
// scale each other variant would need from that body, and why the scale is not enough:
//
//   mk13    x1.000 length, x1.000 diameter — the body as shipped.
//   type91  x1.342 length (5.486/4.089) but x0.791 diameter (0.450/0.569). A uniform x1.342 gives a
//           0.763 m body: 70% too fat. A correct Type 91 is a SEPARATE mesh — longer, markedly
//           slimmer, and carrying the wooden anti-roll box tail the Mod 2 was fitted with in 1941,
//           which the Mark 13's plain ring tail does not have at any scale.
//   type95  x1.749 length (7.15/4.089), x0.937 diameter (0.533/0.569) — again non-uniform, and the
//           Type 95 is a wakeless oxygen weapon with its own tail and no air flask vents.
//   mk14    x1.565 length (6.40/4.089), x0.937 diameter (0.533/0.569) — non-uniform.
//
// So reusing one body for all four, which is what the PRD forbids, is not just a scale error: three
// of the four need their own geometry. Until those exist, a caller should draw only `mk13` from this
// body and accept that the other three have no correct model yet.
