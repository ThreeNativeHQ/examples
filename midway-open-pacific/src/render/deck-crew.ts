 * follow 1942 US carrier practice — the yellow-shirted plane director ahead of the nose, chockmen
 * at the main wheels, plane captain at the engine, ordnance under the wing, fuel and
 * arresting-gear details standing clear of the launch path, and the pilot walking his aircraft
 * before he boards it.
